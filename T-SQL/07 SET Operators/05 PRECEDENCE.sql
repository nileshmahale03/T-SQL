-- Precedence

-- T-SQL supports the following operators: 
-- 1. UNION
-- 2. UNION ALL
-- 3. INTERSECT 
-- 4. EXCEPT

-- In a query that contains multiple set operators, first INTERSECT operators are evaluated, and then operators with the same precedence are evaluated based on their order of appearance.
