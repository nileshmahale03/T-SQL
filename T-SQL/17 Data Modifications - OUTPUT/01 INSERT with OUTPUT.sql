-- DML (Data Modification & Retrieval)
-- DML includes the statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, and MERGE.

-- OUTPUT Clause (Not a statement)

-- Normally, a modification statement just modifies data. 
-- However, sometimes you might find it useful to return information from the modified rows for troubleshooting, auditing, and archiving. 
-- T-SQL supports this capability via a clause called OUTPUT that you add to the modification statement.

-- The OUTPUT clause is designed similarly to the SELECT clause, only you need to prefix the attributes with either the inserted or deleted keyword.
-- In an INSERT statement, you refer to inserted; 
-- In a DELETE statement, you refer to deleted; and 
-- In an UPDATE statement, you refer to deleted for the old state of the row and inserted for the new state.
-- In an MERGE statement, to identify which DML action produced each output row, you can invoke a function called $action in the OUTPUT clause, 
--                        which will return a string representing the action (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).

-- An example for a use case of the OUTPUT clause with an INSERT statement is when you need to insert a row set into a table with an identity column, 
-- and you need to get back all identity values that were generated.
