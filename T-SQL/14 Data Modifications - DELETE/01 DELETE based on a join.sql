-- DML (Data Modification & Retrieval)
-- DML includes the statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, and MERGE.

-- DELETE

-- T-SQL supports a nonstandard DELETE syntax based on joins.
-- This means you can delete rows from one table based on a filter against attributes in related rows from another table.
-- Start with the FROM clause with the joins, move on to the WHERE clause
--, and finally—instead of specifying a SELECT clause—specify a DELETE clause with the alias of the side of the join that is supposed to be the target for the deletion.
