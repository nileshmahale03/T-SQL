-- LEFT OUTER JOIN

-- 1. Apply Cartesian Product - m*n ROWS
-- 2. Apply ON Predicate      - Only rows where ON Predicate is TRUE are returned
-- 3. Add OUTER Rows          - Preserve LEFT side Table

-- Note: 1. ON Predicate serves as a matching purpose, non final
--       2. WHERE Predicate serves as filtering purpose, final
--       2. For OUTER JOIN there is logical difference between ON and WHERE clauses

--Query: you need to query all orders from the Orders table in the TSQLV4 database. You need to ensure that you get at least one row in the output for each date in the range January 1, 2014 through

--       You don’t want to do anything special with dates within the range that have orders, but you do want the output to include the dates with no orders, with NULLs as placeholders in the
