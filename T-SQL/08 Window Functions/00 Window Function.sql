-- Window Functions

-- Window functions, which you can use to apply data-analysis calculations in a flexible and efficient manner.

-- A window function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation against a subset of the rows from the underlying query.
-- The subset of rows is known as a window
-- The syntax for window functions uses a clause called OVER, in which you provide the window specification
