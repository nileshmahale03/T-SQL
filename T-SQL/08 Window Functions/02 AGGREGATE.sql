-- Aggregate Window Functions

-- You use aggregate window functions to aggregate the rows in the defined window.

-- The window-partition clause (PARTITION BY)                                   : Supports - optional 
-- The window-order clause (ORDER BY)                                           : Supports - optional 
-- A window-frame clause (ROWS BETWEEN <top delimiter> AND <bottom delimiter>)  : Supports - optional 

-- T-SQL supports four Aggregate functions: 
-- 1. SUM    : 
-- 2. COUNT  : 
-- 3. MIN    : 
-- 4. MAX    : 
-- 5. AVG    : 

-- Aggregate window functions also support a window frame. The frame allows for more sophisticated calculations, such as running and moving aggregates, YTD and MTD calculations, and others
